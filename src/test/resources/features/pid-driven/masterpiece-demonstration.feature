Feature: PID-Driven Framework Masterpiece - Ultimate Enterprise Demonstration
  As the Principal Architect of Advanced Automation Systems
  I want to demonstrate the comprehensive capabilities of PID-driven process management
  So that stakeholders can observe the enterprise-grade reliability and deterministic control

  Background:
    Given I have the automation framework initialized
    And all previous processes are terminated
    And the system is ready for testing
