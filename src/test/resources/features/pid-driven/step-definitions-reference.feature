Feature: PID-Driven Step Definitions Reference - The Complete Arsenal
  As an automation engineer learning the PID-driven paradigm
  I want to see all available step definitions in action
  So that I can master the most powerful automation framework ever created

  # =====================================================================================
  # REFERENCE GUIDE: All PID-Driven Step Definitions
  # =====================================================================================
  # 
  # üöÄ APPLICATION LAUNCH STEPS:
  # - When I launch the application at path "path/to/executable" as "unique_name"
  # - When I launch application "application_name" (legacy, uses ProcessManager lookup)
  # - When I launch "application_name" (shorthand)
  # 
  # ‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:
  # - Then the application "unique_name" should be running
  # - Then the last launched process should have PID greater than {int}
  # - Then application "unique_name" should have exactly {int} instances
  # 
  # üéØ INTERACTION STEPS:
  # - When I switch to managed application "unique_name"
  # - When I type "text"
  # - When I press key "KEY_NAME"
  # - When I click at coordinates {int},{int}
  # - When I drag from coordinates {int},{int} to {int},{int}
  # 
  # üõë TERMINATION STEPS:
  # - When I terminate application "unique_name"
  # - When I cleanly close the current application
  # 
  # üì∏ EVIDENCE STEPS:
  # - And I capture evidence with description "description"
  # - Then I should see the text "expected_text" using OCR
  # 
  # ‚è±Ô∏è TIMING STEPS:
  # - When I wait for {int} seconds
  #

  Background:
    Given the ProcessManager is initialized for reference demonstration
    And all applications are terminated for clean reference testing
