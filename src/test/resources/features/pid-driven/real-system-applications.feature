Feature: Real System Applications - PID-Driven System Integration
  As a system integration tester
  I want to test real Windows applications using direct paths
  So that I can validate the framework works with actual production software

  Background:
    Given the ProcessManager is initialized for system testing
    And all system application instances are cleaned up
